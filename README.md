## A boilerplate for quickly setting up a single-page React app with: 
  * Sticky navbar!

  * styled-components(ğŸ’…) for styles and animations!

  * Jest + Enzyme for component testing!
  * Really bright, garish colors (deal with it ğŸ•¶)! 

## Setup

* npm run build
* npm start

## Todo

* add eslint + config
